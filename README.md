# \&copy;
A browser extension that lets you copy HTML entities as Unicode characters&nbsp;-- with minimal hassle.

Motivated by the incongruous amount of time I'd been spending on the *[Need a zero-width-space on your clipboard?](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/iLKwm)* codepen, modifying it to copy nbsp, rlm, lrm, combining chars...

## Usage
TBD

## Browser support
- [x] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Edge

## Potential todos
- Firefox support, maybe not Edge (depending on how difficult the latter is)
- Names for common entities
