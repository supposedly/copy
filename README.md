# \&copy;
A browser extension that lets you copy HTML entities as actual symbols&nbsp;-- with minimal hassle.

Motivated by the incongruous amount of time I'd been spending on the
*[Need a zero-width-space on your clipboard?](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/iLKwm)*
codepen, always modifying it to copy a bunch of other characters. No more!

## Usage

- Type your text into the box. It'll be previewed up top. Hit the green button to copy what's in the preview.
- Recently used entities will be added to the left column, and commonly used ones will be added to the right.
  Hover over these buttons to preview them, and click on any to copy what's in its preview.
